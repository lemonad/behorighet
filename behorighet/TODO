Questions
---------
*  Should user's visible qualifications be limited to the units they belong
   to? What if they change units?
*  Should user qualifications be narrowed down to the ones that are within
   the user's units?
*  Should criteria changes *always* have an immediate effect on
   qualifications?
   -  Or should it sometimes be delayed? I.e. Some kind of grace period
      (time or event based).
   -  should qualifications sometimes be permanent, like badges â€” once
      received it could not be revoked, the changes in criteria only
      having an effect on people not qualified?
*  Should selecting sets of units/users report unions or intersections of
   qualifications in term of statistics?
*  Should multiple levels of unit ownership exist? Or should everyone
   else just see aggregated data and no person-by-person data?
*  Should criteria build up qualifications using only AND or is OR-logic
   needed? E.g. Work experience | Education = Qualified.
   The basis in MetCondition is one way of handling it using the current
   design.


Permanent "cache" of qualifications?
------------------------------------
Would have to respond to changes in criteria:
*  If deleted:
   *  Is it the last criterion in a qualification, then either:
      a)  Delete this qualification for all matching users
      b)  Add this qualification to all users (since it has no
          criteria, everyone meets the qualification bar)
Would have to respond to changes in qualifications:
*  If deleted:
   *  Traverse all users and delete qualification.
*  If added:
   *  Traverse all users and add qualifications for those matching
      the respective criteria.
(Potentially) Would have to respond to changes in unit list of qualifications:
*  If added:
   *  None
*  If deleted:
   *  Traverse users in unit and delete qualifications UNLESS they also
      belong to another unit in which the qualification still stands.
